# Capybara::Select2

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/goodwill/capybara-select2.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/goodwill/capybara-select2)

All this gem does is something very simple- allow you to trigger select2 dropdown to select the value you want. The original select doesn't with the javascript overrides, so this new helper method does only this thing.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'capybara-select2', group: :test

Or, add it into your test group

    group :test do
      gem 'capybara-select2'
      ...
    end

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install capybara-select2

The gem automatically hook itself into rspec helper using Rspec.configure.

## Usage

Just use this method inside your capybara test:

    select2("Dropdown Text", from: "Label of the dropdown")

or

    select2("Dropdown Text", xpath: "<xpath of the dropdown>")

If the select2 field has a `min_length` option (acts as a search field) specify it with:

    select2("foo", from: "Label of the dropdown", search: true)

If select2 field has [tags](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/#tags) option you can use:

```ruby
select2_tag('value', from: 'Label of input')
```

For Ajax (remote)
```ruby
select2_ajax('value', from: 'Label of input')
```
